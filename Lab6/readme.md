### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
An IP address is the unique set of numbers assigned to every device that is connected to the internet and is used to identify anything connecting to a network. The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the difference in size between their pool of addresses. With IPv4 having a pool of 4 billion addresses, IPv6 has a much larger pool of addresses at 340 undecillion. This is mainly a result of how IPv6 is formatted compared to IPv4, IPv4 uses strings of 4 numbers between 0 and 255 seperated by periods. IPv6 addresses use much longer strings of numbers and are converted using hexadecimals in order to simplify them.
