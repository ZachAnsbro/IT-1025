## Executive Summary 
Over the course of this lab, we learned various things from file compression to object oriented programming. File compression is something I was previously familiar with as it is an easy way to send or recieve a group of larger files. It was interesting to look at OOP and start to learn how programs are created with specific objectives in mind. This is something I have been looking forward to learning more about and is definitely something I would like to become more familiar with. 

## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of file compression is to group multiple files in one compressed file in order to reduce the file size, making it faster to upload and download when sending it to other users. 
### Compression and File Size
The compressed file size was almost half the size of the original file. If we were to do this with a .jpg file it would not compress nearly as much since that type of file is already compressed. 
## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes:
The shark class has two attributes, one for swimming and one for being awesome. 
### Methods:
The methods of the shark class are defining the function and printing the result. 
### Constructor:
The constructor method is used to automatically initialize data by running it as soon as the object of a class is set. 
### Class vs. Object
Classes are like blueprints that are defined to create objects. Objects use the blueprint created by the class to add data and methods. To instantiate an object from a class is essentially to create a copy of the class that will inherit all of the data and methods. 
## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Objects
The instantiated objects of the shark class are all of the classes attributes and methods. 
### Inheritance
Classes can be created out of other classes with the original class being referred to as the base class and the one being created out of it is called a derived class. When creating a derived class, it will inherit all of the attributes and behaviors of the base class and can use additional attributes. 
### Encapsulation and Abstraction
## Unified Modeling Language (UML)

## Conclusion
Overall, this lab went over a lot of new things that I am eager to continue learning about. Other than file compression, this lab was mainly new concepts for me and was a bit hard to understand at some points but through reading and doing examples became much easier to understand. Learning how classes and objects work and are created was something that seemed difficult at first but made a lot more sense once I got to actually create both. They both seem very useful and I can see how class inheritance would be a huge tool to help you be more efficient in programming.
