## Executive Summary 
We have gone over various concepts in this lab that all gave good knowledge on things like operating systems and their systems commmand line, going further into python using an IDLE to explore typing different examples of code and running those programs, along with graphic rendering, compression, and even design by creating a logo. Using the Windows 10 operating system on my computer is something I have been comfortable with for a long time but using the command prompt is something I have not worked with a lot. It was also nice to be able to actually use python to create a small program and run it. It was very interesting to explore the different types of image rendering and compression which I had not known a lot about beforehand. Getting to do a small bit of graphic design was also fun as it is something I have always wanted to experiment with. 

## Python IDLE
The difference between the shell and the file editor is that the shell will run lines of code one at a time while the file editor can be used to run entire programs. The shell is good for experimenting and the file editor is good for running actual programs. 
## Code Examples
### Variable:
A variable is a way that you can save a value to your computers memory by declaring a name for the value to be equal to. Spam, bacon, and eggs are often used as variable examples in Python because of the spam comedy sketch from Monty Python. 
### Assignment statement:
An assignment statement is the method of declaring a name for a variable by setting the name equal to the variable. Names are typically used to describe the data the variable contains. An example of an assignment statement would be spam = 42. 
### Function:
Functions are like smaller programs that run inside of your program and contain code that can do various things. In Python code, a function would start with the functions name and is followed by parenthesis sometimes carrying values that are passed to the function called arguments. To call the print function in Python you would type, print ('Hello world!') to call the print function to print 'Hello world! when the program is run. 
### Three data types:
The three data types we learned about in Python are Integers or ints, floating points also known as floats, and strings also called strs. Integers are whole numbers like the number 2 and floats are numbers with a decimal point like 2.5. While strings are text values surrounded by single quotes like 'Hello world!'. 

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
A raster image is an image that is made up of thousands of small pixels. When the image is viewed at it's original size the image is clear and pixels are not visible because they are far too small to see. When a raster image is enlarged or zoomed in, the pixels become much easier to see and the image appears blurry. This type of image could be used as a profile picture on a social media website. A vector image is different in the way that it can be increased or decreased in size without losing quality. This is because these types of graphics are made with a special type of geometry that renders lines and shapes into a two or three-dimensional space instead of being made up of pixels. This type of image would work well as a company's logo as it will maintain good image quality no matter what size it is used as.  
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
The difference between lossless and lossy compression is that with lossless compression all data from the original image is maintained, whereas lossy compression discards some of the data from the original image and is saved with a reduced file size. Lossy compression can be used to create smaller file sizes and can give a result very close to the original, lossless compression would be best suited when a difference could not be seen between the original and the compression. 
### File Formats
GIF, JPEG, and PNG files are all examples of image compression file types. GIF files are images in a bitmap image format that supports 8 bits per pixel allowing up to 256 different RGB colors. A GIF image is also the only format that allows for animated images. The JPEG image format uses lossy compression to create smaller file sizes and allows the designer to choose how much compression is used in order to preserve quality. PNG images are another example of a bitmap image format and was created to replace the GIF image format. These files allow for pallete-based colors, greyscale, RGBA, and RGB color spaces along with support for transparency options. 
### File Properties
Under the file properties for this image you can see the size of the file which is 578KB and the files location where it is being stored on your drive. you can also view what the file will be opened with along with what type of file it is. 
## Conclusion

Overall, this lab gave me a lot of good information on things like operating systems, using an IDLE to run Python code, and computer graphics. It is very interesting to learn about a lot of the things that I see being used everyday, but never had an actual understanding of how it is really working. The labs in this class have already taught me a tremendous amount about different computer processes and what is going on that we can not see. I look forward to learning Python more and overall improving my programming knowledge.
