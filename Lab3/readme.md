## Executive Summary 
Throughout this lab, we explored a wide range of things from different types of software and programming languages like Python, to exploring internships and careers in the IT field. This was an exciting lesson for me as I am very interested in software and programming and am still eager to go further in depth with these topics. Learning a programming language is something I have wanted to start and seeing how simple Python works encourages me to learn more about it and become more familiar with it. It was also nice to learn about all of the certifications and internships that Tri-C has to offer. 

## Software
Application software is used to run programs for all different purposes like using an internet browser, putting numbers into a spreadsheet, or typing a paper into Microsoft Word. Utility software would be programs that let you fix, clean, or modify your computer such as an anti-malware software. An operating system is there to manage all of the programs in the computer and provide an interface for the user. Examples of operating system software would be Windows, MacOS, or Linux. 
### Types of Software
### ERP
The Enterprise Resource Planning system is utilized to keep an entire organizations data in one single program. This single program is used throughout the entire organization and holds all of the organizations information in one single data source. Popular ERP systems include Microsoft, SAP, and Oracle. 
## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Virtualization allows you to split tasks among a single server so that hardware can be used more efficiently and save money. 
### Role of Hypervisor
Hypervisors were developed to allow mutliple users access to computers that ran batch processing. 
## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
The pseudo-code nature of Python allows users to focus on solving their problem rather than the syntax of the language itself. 
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language needs to be converted from it's source language into a language that the computer can understand. An interpreted language can execute programs directly without the need to be translated so the computer can understand. 
## Career Exploration
### Handshake
I am very interested in doing an internship during my time at Tri-C and this resource makes it much easier to find a variety of internships that are geared toward my interests and what I would like to go into. 
### Bureau of Labor Statistics
On this website I looked at careers in software development and found that the median pay for this job is around $52 an hour and that the job outlook is better than average at 22%. 
### Certifications
Certifications seem like a great way to gain knowledge and experience towards a career in IT. 
### Certificates and Degrees
One certificate that sticks out to me is the post-degree certificate in .NET programming. I feel this certification would be a good match with my major to help me get a job in programming or software development. 
### Co-ops / Internships
To become co-op "ready" you have to fill out the experiential learning application of interest. By doing so, you gain hands on experience with job assignments related to your field and allows you to use what you have learned in the classroom. 
### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
The cybersecurity club seems like a great way to become more connected to the students in my field of study at Tri-C and to collaborate with other students. 
## Conclusion

Overall, this lab was very beneficial and resourceful to me as I got a basic understanding of how Python works, and a look at how I can get internships and opportunities for hands on experience. I was also happy to be able to begin learning about different types of software and how each is used. Everything we went over in this lab has given me good knowledge on things I have been looking forward to learning about at Tri-C. I hope to continue going further into each of these things and learning more about my options and resources here at Tri-C.
