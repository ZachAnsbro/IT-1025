## Executive Summary 
Through the course of this lab, we went through various topics regarding the internet and web pages. We covered internet architecture which went over attributes of different web pages and how they function using IP addresses. We also went over web programming with HTML and CSS to create a web page with different different features known as tags. The last thing we went over in this lab was file paths and URL's. I have used HTML and CSS in previous courses to create simple webpages similar to what we did in this lab, though it was a nice refresher to work with it again. Going into the lab, I had some knowledge on IP addresses and how they work but feel I understand a lot better how devices are able to connect to different networks. 

## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
An IP address is the unique set of numbers assigned to every device that is connected to the internet and is used to identify anything connecting to a network. The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the difference in size between their pool of addresses. With IPv4 having a pool of 4 billion addresses, IPv6 has a much larger pool of addresses at 340 undecillion. This is mainly a result of how IPv6 is formatted compared to IPv4, IPv4 uses strings of 4 numbers between 0 and 255 seperated by periods. IPv6 addresses use much longer strings of numbers and are converted using hexadecimals in order to simplify them. 
#### ICANN
The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation that keeps the internet stable and secure by developing policy on all of the internets IP addresses and impacts the expansion and evolution of the internet. 
### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
The responsibility of TCP/IP is to create the connection between two devices using their IP addresses to allow them to route data back and forth to each other. 
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
The client-server model applies to TCP/IP in the way that the client is trying to reach the server via the IP address so that it is able to access whatever data they are looking for. 
#### Layers
Layers are important to changing technology because without them everything within an application would need to be revised to accomadate to a single change. Layers give the ability to create changes to one section without the need to change everything else about the process. 
#### Application Layer
HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, and SMTP are all examples of types of applications that run on the application layer. 
## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and is used to view web pages on the internet. This supports the client-server model in the way that the data is being exchanged back and forth from your computer, the client, to the web pages server. 
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
Secure HTTP is the same as HTTP with a security feature that encrypts the data that is being taken in using HTTP by using encryption algorithms. 
## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
It is a good idea to use a secured browser due to the fact that almost all computers have web browsers and are used very frequently. This creates a high risk of encountering issues like spyware or someone gaining access to your computer. 
### Risk Explained
Attackers can create webpages that once opened, will install spyware that can steal your information from your computer. 
## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web and created the W3C in order to develop protocols and guidelines that promote the long-term growth of the Web. 
### HTML5 and CSS
The purpose of how I used to HTML5 and CSS was to create a simple example of a webpage that briefly goes over a topic of our choice. In my example I chose to make the page about the Cleveland Browns and used the HTML5 heading, body, paragraph, and attributes tags along with the CSS style tag to create a color scheme throughout all of my HTML tags. 
### HTML and XML
The difference between HTML and XML is that XML was created to carry data while HTML was created to display data. 
## Components of a URL
Scheme: https
Domain: www.amazon.com
Top level Domain: .edu
Default page: result of search
Parameters: no file path provided
Anchor: specific location on a page
## Conclusion
Overall, this lab taught me a lot of new things that I was not familiar with before and even gave me a good refresher of how to use HTML and CSS to form a webpage. When looking at internet architecture, it was interesting to be able to connect the section on hypertext transfer protocol back to the client-server model we had previously talked about. In doing so I felt that the things we are learning are sticking with me quite well, as anytime we look back on something we had from a past lesson I am able to remember it quite easily. It was fun to be able to create a small webpage and get to write a few lines of code, even if it was very simple!
