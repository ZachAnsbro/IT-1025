### Executive Summary

For this final project, I have opted to implement code into a program in order to create a web page of my resume. I chose this because it is a mix of something I am very interested in potentially finding a career in and also because I have enjoyed working with programming web pages in this class and in past experiences. I hope to be able to add a lot more detail and style than I have been able to in the past. I feel this will be a good way that I can show how this class has improved my skills as a programmer while also showcasing many of the other things I have attained in this class. 

### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan

I am choosing to go with option two and plan to imlement code in to a program. I hope to create a simple application or webpage that is styled neatly and is easy to understand. 

### Project Part 2: Implementation

For this project I decided to implement code to create a website of my resume. I chose to do this because I am very interested in web development and wanted to see how far I've come from the last time I tried to make a web page with HTML and CSS. The website displays my resume and each part of it including contact information, experience, skills, and more. The files I have attached are the screenshots of my web page, and the screenshots of my code. 

### Conclusion

Overall, this class has given me the opportunity to learn a lot of new things in the IT world that I did not expect to learn so soon. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the lessons we have done in this class and feel that I have retained a lot of knowledge. This course was the first in a while that I was truly able to enjoy everything I have learned about and will be able to actually use a lot of what we have learned. This makes me very excited for future IT courses I will be taking here at Tri-C and honestly for the first time in my life, makes me look forward to being able to participate in classes and expand on my knowledge. It was very interesting to try and make a full web page with HTML and CSS since I have not done so in a while. I feel I have improved my skills a lot from my last attempt and can navigate both languages much better. Although, in the future I would like to get better at working with CSS in order to make my websites much cleaner. I am interested to try and do this again maybe a year from now and see the progress that I've made from this one.
