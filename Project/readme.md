### Executive Summary

For this final project, I have opted to implement code into a program in order to create a web page of my resume. I chose this because it is a mix of something I am very interested in potentially finding a career in and also because I have enjoyed working with programming web pages in this class and in past experiences. I hope to be able to add a lot more detail and style than I have been able to in the past. I feel this will be a good way that I can show how this class has improved my skills as a programmer while also showcasing many of the other things I have attained in this class. 

### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan

I am choosing to go with option two and plan to imlement code in to a program. I hope to create a simple application or webpage that has user input capability. 

### Project Part 2:

If you elected option 1 describe the process you followed to become co-op ready and the name of your career coach OR, for option 2, present your program, application, reach etc.  There is no specific guidelines on the length or development success.  Some students plan on creating an app and find that they only got to determining the full purpose, outcomes and technology which is fine.  The purpose of the project is to take a topic of particular interest to you and spend some more time to gain a deeper level of understanding.

### Conclusion

Overall, this class has given me the opportunity to learn a lot of new things in the IT world that I did not expect to learn so soon. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the lessons we have done in this class and feel that I have retained a lot of knowledge. This course was the first in a while that I was truly able to enjoy everything I have learned about and will be able to actually use a lot of what we have learned. This makes me very excited for future IT courses I will be taking here at Tri-C and honestly for the first time in my life, makes me look forward to being able to participate in classes and expand on my knowledge.
