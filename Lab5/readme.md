## Lucidchart
Getting started with Lucidchart was very simple and easy to understand how it works. It is a very user friendly tool used to create diagrams and charts for all different types fo applications. The website is very straightforward and gives many tips to help improve your productivity with it. Having other resources to help with formatting and what shapes to use in certain situations was also very helpful in getting to know this website. 
## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission

#### Packet: Unit of data
#### Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
#### IP Address: Unique identifying number

#### DNS: Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com

#### Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

These terms are all related in the sense that they all work together with your computer in order to reach a desired outcome on the internet for things like looking up a video on Youtube or shopping online. 
### Networking Hardware
#### Switch vs. Hub
Both of these devices are able to connect to other devices on the network via an ethernet cable, and send data to any of the devices that are connected. The main difference in the two is that a hub can not differentiate which device is supposed to recieve the data that is being sent and in turn sends it to all connected devices. Switches however, are smarter in the way that they are able to tell which device is meant to recieve the data and will send it to only those certain devices by storing the addresses of each connected device. 
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub
A router is a device that can route data from one network to another via the IP address. It can recieve data to it's own network or send the data to another network. Essentially, switches and hubs are used to connect devices on their own network, routers are used to connect devices on it's network to other networks. 
### Network Topologies
#### Single point of Failure
A single point of failure occurs when a central point that connects all of it's computers fails and affects all of the connected devices. The most common type of topology that is affected by this failure is the star topology where all computers are connected to a central wiring point like a hub or switch. 
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
 In a wireless infrastructure topology, there are a combination of wired and wireless devices connecting to the network. The wired devices are connected to a switch or hub, where as the wireless connections are connected to a wireless access point that is connected to the switch or hub like a bridge between the wired and wireless network. A wireless mesh topology is where devices are wirelessly interconnected with each other on the network. This would create a strong internet connection for wireless devices to connect to no matter where they are connecting to on the network due to each accesss point communicating with each other and back to the modem. I feel that a wireless mesh topology would be more beneficial in most circumstances due to the fact that it is able to spread the internet connection over multiple wireless access points and allow devices to have a strong connection in any location.
