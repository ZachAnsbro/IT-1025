## Executive Summary 
In this lab, we went over various topics dealing with networking and data transmission, cybersecurity and encryption, and using Lucidchart to create diagrams. Starting with Lucidchart, I was able to pick this up quickly and get familiar with how it works and the many different ways it could be applied. The introduction to networking was very interesting to be able to understand more about how networks are setup and how they can communicate with other networks. This was the first time I had gone more in depth with encryption and was kind of difficult at first to understand how some of it works. After going through each of these sections a few times I was able to gain a working knowledge on how most of these systems work. 

## Lucidchart
Getting started with Lucidchart was very simple and easy to understand how it works. It is a very user friendly tool used to create diagrams and charts for all different types fo applications. The website is very straightforward and gives many tips to help improve your productivity with it. Having other resources to help with formatting and what shapes to use in certain situations was also very helpful in getting to know this website. 
## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission

#### Packet: Unit of data
#### Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
#### IP Address: Unique identifying number

#### DNS: Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com

#### Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

These terms are all related in the sense that they all work together with your computer in order to reach a desired outcome on the internet for things like looking up a video on Youtube or shopping online. 
### Networking Hardware
#### Switch vs. Hub
Both of these devices are able to connect to other devices on the network via an ethernet cable, and send data to any of the devices that are connected. The main difference in the two is that a hub can not differentiate which device is supposed to recieve the data that is being sent and in turn sends it to all connected devices. Switches however, are smarter in the way that they are able to tell which device is meant to recieve the data and will send it to only those certain devices by storing the addresses of each connected device. 
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub
A router is a device that can route data from one network to another via the IP address. It can recieve data to it's own network or send the data to another network. Essentially, switches and hubs are used to connect devices on their own network, routers are used to connect devices on it's network to other networks. 
### Network Topologies
#### Single point of Failure
A single point of failure occurs when a central point that connects all of it's computers fails and affects all of the connected devices. The most common type of topology that is affected by this failure is the star topology where all computers are connected to a central wiring point like a hub or switch. 
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
 In a wireless infrastructure topology, there are a combination of wired and wireless devices connecting to the network. The wired devices are connected to a switch or hub, where as the wireless connections are connected to a wireless access point that is connected to the switch or hub like a bridge between the wired and wireless network. A wireless mesh topology is where devices are wirelessly interconnected with each other on the network. This would create a strong internet connection for wireless devices to connect to no matter where they are connecting to on the network due to each accesss point communicating with each other and back to the modem. I feel that a wireless mesh topology would be more beneficial in most circumstances due to the fact that it is able to spread the internet connection over multiple wireless access points and allow devices to have a strong connection in any location. 
### Network Design
### NSA/CSS
The NSA's role in cybersecurity is to prevent and stop threats to the United States security systems. It's focus is to improve the overall security systems in the U.S. and to increase cybersecurity education and careers. 
## Cybersecurity and Encryption

### Information Systems Security

#### Security Triad
The confidentiality component of the security triad would impact the approach of amazons online chat in the sense that only those with authorized access could read messages so that messages are going to the correct people. Integrity would impact this in the way that messages sent could not be altered by someone who is not authorized. Availability would affect this by creating an appropriate time frame that authorized users could use these servers to chat. In this sense, the servers would likely need to be accessable 24/7. 
#### Authentication
Examples of authentication being used would be signing into an e-mail with your username and password, logging on to a computer with it's password, or signing in to a social media account like facebook. Each of these could use multi-factor authentication by requiring you to answer a security question or using something like a fingerprint scan. 
#### ACL and RBAC
ACL, or Access Control Lists are used to identify a list of users that have the ability to perform certain actions based on their specific permissions. Role-based access control, or RBAC gives users roles and in turn, each role is assigned different access rights. This allows for simplified administration and better security. 
#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key
The public key is used to encrypt a message that is being sent to a user that will decrypt the message with the private key. The ciphertext is sent through the communication channel and is encrypted so that it can not be understood until it is decrypted by the recipient with the private key. 
#### Public Key Cryptography
Public key encryption is important because without the use of a private key, it would be easy for a third party to decrypt the key that is being used and in turn, give them access to what is being sent. 
### Cryptography
#### Encryption
This encryption is done by taking the original message that is writted and moving each letter a set amount of spaces down the alphabet. My encryption came out to be gvctxskvetlc mw e kvsamrk jmiph. 
#### Frequency Fingerprint
This is showing how frequently each letter of your language is used compared to how frequent it is in your message. This would likely vary among other languages due to the fact that other languages have completely different alphabets. 
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher
Polyalphabetic ciphers create a flatter distribution of letter frequencies by creating more than one shift in the cipher. This increases the time it takes to determine the length of shift in each word used. 
#### Polyalphabetic Example
The message is encrypted by utilizing the shift word to determine the length of shifts for each letter by using the number associated with where each letter in the shift word falls in the alphabet. 
#### Brute-Force
A brute force attack is used to try every possible key to decrypt a cipher by using a key to decrypt the cypher and moving on to the next one until the message is able to be read. 
## Conclusion
Overall, this lab went much further in depth on many things I had not known a lot about beforehand. Getting to understand some of these new concepts like network topology and polyalphabetic ciphers was kind of difficult at first but very rewarding once I started to understand them more. It is interesting to gain more knowledge on things that are being used every day in technology. This lesson has given me the opportunity to expand my interests and give thought to other careers in IT. The lessons in this class never fail to increase my interests in IT and I look forward to continuing my exploration of new subjects as we move further into this class.
