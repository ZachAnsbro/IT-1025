## Executive Summary 
This lesson mainly went over how databases work and how the data is actually collected and manipulated. It is very interesting to me the sheer amount of data there is in the digital world today and how it is only ever going to expand. I enjoyed getting to work with SQL and being introduced to how databases are used and operated. Althoug SQL is something very new to me, it seems very intuitive and would be something I would like to continue learning about in the future. 

## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
The three terms data, information, and knowledge are all words that are used interchangeably but have distinct definitions depending on the situation. Data is pieces of information without any context and can be quantitative or qualitative. While information is data that is either processed or calculated in some way to give it relevance and actual meaning. Knowledge is the actual use of information to make relationships and draw conclusions about the data. 
### Relational Data
#### Primary Key:
The primary keys here would be the customers name and the products on the order.
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
The tables would be related by the customers name and what that particular customer ordered.
#### Foreign key of orders table:
The foreign key in the orders table would be the order number or however the order is identified. 
### Field Data Types
It is important to porperly define a data type because this is what indicates to the database what can be done with the data. It is also importnat so that there is enough storage allocated for the data. 
### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
Volume: The volume of the data is used to determine whether or not data can be considered as Big Data.
Variety: Variety refers to the many different forms that data can come in. This includes emails, photos, PDFs, etc.
Velocity: Velocity refers to the speed at which the data is generated and processed.
Variability: Variability is the inconsistency that data can show and how it can affect how easily the data can be managed. 
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
Examples of technology that has driven the need for big data are things like social media and online stores. 
## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
RDBMS is a type of database management system that utilizes tables to store it's data. SQL is the language that is used to access all of these databases. 
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys

## SQL Injections
SQL injection is a security due to the fact that it is the most common web hacking technique and can be used to destroy an entire database. SQL parameters are used to protect databases from this injection by adding the values of the parameter at execution time. 
## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
A code of ethics is an outline of acceptable behaviors in a professional enviornment or any group of people. This is used by the ACM because it draws a line of acceptable behavior for a professional group. This allows people with different backgrounds and ideas to have a clear standard of what is and what isn't acceptable. 
### Intellectual Property
A trademark would protect the logo from being used or stolen by other entities. Copyrighting the image would be important so that you exclusively can control what can be done with your image and how it can be used. 
### Information Collection
COPPA restricts the collection of data from users under the age of thirteen years old by determining if the user is under thirteen and if they are, requiring parental consent to further collect data. FERPA protects the privacy of a student's education records, allowing parental access to education records until the student is eighteen. After that, the child is given full control of the information. HIPAA specifically protects patients medical records and requires those who maintain these records to get consent to share it. 
## Conclusion
In conclusion, this lab covered a lot of interesting topics with my favorite being SQL and how it used to access and manuever data inside of databases utilizing RDBMS. This was somewhat of a hard concept to understand at first but once I got used to using the different commands and operators, it became quite simple and was easy to read and understand. I have known about ethical and legal issues with data collection and intellectual property but I did enjoy getting a more thorough understanding of how these laws and code of ethics are set and used. Overall, this lab has taught me a lot of new things about databases and made me more knowledgeable on computing ethics and legal issues involving intellectual property.
