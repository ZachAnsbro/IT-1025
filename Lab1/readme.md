## Executive Summary
The goal of Lab 1 was to become familiar with the class structure, introdue us to Github, use the snipping tool for a screen capture, and read about information systems and their components. Github allows you to create a repository where you can add or edit a file with the ability to collaborate with other users. Using the snipping tool is something I am familiar with using in previous classes and other applications to take screenshots. Information systems and their components have evolved tremendously over the last 70 years. It is fascinating the effect this has had on businesses and organizations allowing them to connect globally and create solutions for a variety of issues. 

## Information System Components
Hardware: Computers 
Software: Operating systems such as Windows
Data: A phone number or zip code
People: Developers and systems analysts
Processes: Business process re-engineering

## GitHub
### Client - Server Architecture
Client-server refers to a central computer acting as the server sending data to the clients connected over the network. Github is the server sending data to it's users, the client, allowing them to collaborate and create projects over the network. 
### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the mobile access of data and storage over the internet from a remote server. An example of this would be Dropbox, a storage and sharing system for files such as pictures. 
## Conclusion
Throughout this lab I got comfortable with how this class will operate as well as navigating through Github for future labs. I also gained good knowledge on information systems and how they connect with client-server architecture. It is very interesting to see how these things work and makes me excited to keep learning. With this lab only scratching the surface of software, I am eager to learn more about this topic as I would like to work in this component of information systems.
