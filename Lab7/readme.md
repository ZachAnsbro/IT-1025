## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of file compression is to group multiple files in one compressed file in order to reduce the file size, making it faster to upload and download when sending it to other users. 
### Compression and File Size
The compressed file size was almost half the size of the original file. If we were to do this with a .jpg file it would not compress nearly as much since that type of file is already compressed.
