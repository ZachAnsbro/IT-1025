## Python IDLE
The difference between the shell and the file editor is that the shell will run lines of code one at a time while the file editor can be used to run entire programs. The shell is good for experimenting and the file editor is good for running actual programs. 
## Code Examples
### Variable:
A variable is a way that you can save a value to your computers memory by declaring a name for the value to be equal to. Spam, bacon, and eggs are often used as variable examples in Python because of the spam comedy sketch from Monty Python. 
### Assignment statement:
An assignment statement is the method of declaring a name for a variable by setting the name equal to the variable. Names are typically used to describe the data the variable contains. An example of an assignment statement would be spam = 42. 
### Function:
Functions are like smaller programs that run inside of your program and contain code that can do various things. In Python code, a function would start with the functions name and is followed by parenthesis sometimes carrying values that are passed to the function called arguments. To call the print function in Python you would type, print ('Hello world!') to call the print function to print 'Hello world! when the program is run. 
### Three data types:
The three data types we learned about in Python are Integers or ints, floating points also known as floats, and strings also called strs. Integers are whole numbers like the number 2 and floats are numbers with a decimal point like 2.5. While strings are text values surrounded by single quotes like 'Hello world!'.
