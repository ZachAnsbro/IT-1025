## Executive Summary 
In this lab we learned many things about computer hardware, how computers recieve data, and what the computer does with that data to give a desired outcome. I have some knowledge and experience with computer hardware and how it is put together but was really interested to see what each individual component is actually doing inside and how everything works together. Learning how binary and other data representations work is also something that has always interested me. It was very cool to get to see how a computer actually takes in the data it's recieving and uses it to create an output almost instantly. 

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
The difference in latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive is that latency is the average time it takes the drive to rotate the sector being seeked into position under the head. While the transfer rate is the speed that data is transferred to and from the drive. 
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Though both are used for computer storage, solid state drives and hard drives differ in how they work. In an SSD there are no actual moving parts like a disk drive, instead of seeking the correct places on the disk an SSD stores data in memory and can be accessed by its addresses almost instantly similar to how RAM works. 
#### Random Access Memory
Increasing RAM allows the computer to load more data into the RAM without needing to access the hard drive which would cause the process to slow down. 
64 and 32 bit data paths refer to the number of data bits being transferred in a single clock cycle. Because of this, a 64 bit data path is twice as fast as a 32 bit data path as it can transfer twice the amount of data in a single clock. 
### ALU and the Control Unit
The ALU takes the inputs while the control unit gets the intruction from the RAM and tells the ALU what operation needs to be performed on the inputs so the ALU can output the answer. 
### CPU, Input & Output
In this example the amount of money you put in the machine for your gas would be the input. The pump will store this information like RAM would and calculate the amount of gas you will get for how much money is being inputed like a CPU. From there, the amount of gas you payed for will be puumped out of the machine as an output. 
### Logic Gates 
Truth tables show the output you will get from every possible input. 
The AND gate truth table will only produce an output of one if both inputs are one. Whereas an OR gate will produce an output of one as long as one of the inputs is a one. 
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE's main purpose is to make technological advancements and innovations to benefit all of humanity. Their focus on ethics is to hold a high standard of integrity, responsible behavior, and ethical conduct in professional activities. 
## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Decimal number system uses 10 as its base value while binary uses 2 as its base value and hexadecimal uses 16 as its base value. 
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
Before using it should be considered that it may be hard to read that bright of a color on a white or black background. 
## Conclusion
Include your conclusion here...
Overall, this lab went through a lot of useful information that gave me a much better understanding of how computers actually work and what is going on inside of each individual component. I feel very comfortable using and converting the two new number systems I learneed about throughout this lab, even though the hexadecimal system was confusing at first I was able to work my way through and get a good understanding of it. Logic gates and truth tables were also something very new to me and is very fascinating how they work and deliver binary data to the CPU. This lab taught me many new things, all of which kept me interested and excited to learn more.
