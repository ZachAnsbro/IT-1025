## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
An IP address is the unique set of numbers assigned to every device that is connected to the internet and is used to identify anything connecting to a network. The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the difference in size between their pool of addresses. With IPv4 having a pool of 4 billion addresses, IPv6 has a much larger pool of addresses at 340 undecillion. This is mainly a result of how IPv6 is formatted compared to IPv4, IPv4 uses strings of 4 numbers between 0 and 255 seperated by periods. IPv6 addresses use much longer strings of numbers and are converted using hexadecimals in order to simplify them. 
#### ICANN
The International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation that keeps the internet stable and secure by developing policy on all of the internets IP addresses and impacts the expansion and evolution of the internet. 
### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
The responsibility of TCP/IP is to create the connection between two devices using their IP addresses to allow them to route data back and forth to each other. 
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
The client-server model applies to TCP/IP in the way that the client is trying to reach the server via the IP address so that it is able to access whatever data they are looking for. 
#### Layers
Layers are important to changing technology because without them everything within an application would need to be revised to accomadate to a single change. Layers give the ability to create changes to one section without the need to change everything else about the process. 
#### Application Layer
HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, and SMTP are all examples of types of applications that run on the application layer. 
## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and is used to view web pages on the internet. This supports the client-server model in the way that the data is being exchanged back and forth from your computer, the client, to the web pages server. 
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
Secure HTTP is the same as HTTP with a security feature that encrypts the data that is being taken in using HTTP by using encryption algorithms. 
## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
It is a good idea to use a secured browser due to the fact that almost all computers have web browsers and are used very frequently. This creates a high risk of encountering issues like spyware or someone gaining access to your computer. 
### Risk Explained
Attackers can create webpages that once opened, will install spyware that can steal your information from your computer. 
## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web and created the W3C in order to develop protocols and guidelines that promote the long-term growth of the Web. 
### HTML5 and CSS
### HTML and XML
